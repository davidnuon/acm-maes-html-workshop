		<p>
			Tard the Grumpy Cat (short for "Tardar Sauce") is an Internet celebrity that has gained worldwide recognition for her hilarious facial features, which make her look like she is permanently frowning. The top parts of her eyes are slightly furrowed and her mouth naturally shaped in a strong downward facing curve. She definitely does’t look like a very happy kitty.
			
			Even though she looks so displeased, it’s hard not to find her completely adorable at the same time. The world has never seen a cat with such a human-like facial expression.
